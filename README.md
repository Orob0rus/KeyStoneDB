# KeyStoneDB

KeyStoneDB is a key-value distributed database system designed for educational purposes and to explore popular algorithms and data structures. This project is inspired by the principles outlined in books like "Designing Data-Intensive Applications," insights from "Database Internals," and research papers on systems like Memcached and Amazon Dynamo.

**Note**: KeyStoneDB is not intended for production use. It's a toy implementation for learning and practicing distributed systems concepts, and it may not provide the robustness, scalability, or security required in a production environment.

## Features

- Key-Value Store: Store and retrieve data using a simple key-value interface.
- Distributed Architecture: Learn about distributed systems by working with a distributed database.
- Algorithm Implementations: Practice implementing algorithms and data structures relevant to distributed databases.
- Educational Tool: Use KeyStoneDB to gain insights into the internals of distributed systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with KeyStoneDB, follow these steps:

 **TODO**: Will update as I make progress

## Documentation
For detailed usage and developer documentation, please refer to the project's documentation. TODO: Add the notion doc for the design tradeoffs and references for the algorithms/ data-strucutres/ implementations.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to fix a bug, add a new feature, or improve documentation, your input is highly appreciated. Please follow our Contribution Guidelines to get started. TODO: Add the notion doc for the How to contribute guidelines.
